  <h1>ONE TO ONE COACHING TESTIMONIALS</h1>
  <p>"I became involved with Janine, though the AIB Executive Coaching Programme in the summer of 2015.  The business area, I was involved with was going through a great deal of change and personally I was at a cross roads in my career, and the direction I wanted to take.   Janine was a tremendous help to me in both dealing with my own personal career changes, but also in supporting my team with the challenges of working in a change environment. The work that she undertook with me, allowed me to focus on my strengths, build my confidence and to provide a structured approach for me to face both the day to day and longer term challenges of Leadership.   I have now moved to a new role, which I am delighted with and is providing all the challenge that I required. Janine is particularly engaging, and hugely perceptive and I particularly enjoyed that she challenged my perceptions and was direct in her approach to the areas I required to work on.  I have found the whole experience, so far, energising and uplifting and it is great to know I have someone in my corner. I would wholeheartedly recommend Janine to professionals who wish to focus on  strengthening their leadership style and also those that are at a career cross roads, because she will help you plot the map that will give you direction"

  <p>"Janine and I have been working together for the past two years. During this time, her coaching has equipped me with the attitude and skills to approach and negotiate difficult relationships and situations in the workplace. I have also found these skills to be beneficial in my personal life. Working with Janine has been both challenging and rewarding, and I can confidently say that meeting Janine has changed my life for the better"
  <p>Bryan Conneely – Technical Lead Paddy Power Betfair 
  <p>"I worked on leadership development with Janine from Highnoon and found her approach to be very different from anything I had previously experienced in leadership training. Her technique included very little text book work and was more about removing inhibitions and building confidence than anything else. The sessions, ranging from between one hour to two hours, were very intensive and fast moving. Initially I found myself being constantly challenged in so many ways, but as the sessions continued, my ability to deal with those challenges strengthened to a level where the training evolved into conversations. I would strongly recommend videoing perhaps the earlier sessions and the final one. The change, in my experience, was both stark and enlightening"

  <p>"Having worked in O2 for a decade in a number of senior management positions and as a consequence of organisational changes I started working with Janine Bunnetta. Albeit a challenging period in my professional career Janine’s influence enabled me to deliver the change O2 required and come through the situation with integrity, confidence and a clear vision of what the future looked like. There are a number of dimensions that set Janine apart. She has experience in senior management positions in large complex organisations. In addition to giving her credibility she appreciates how organisations work (especially during change) and the challenges her client’s face.  This isn’t rehearsed empathy but the benefit of years of experience and a deep-seated passion for guiding her clients through uncharted waters. Janine builds upon a solid foundation of analytical tools and pre-work that challenges her clients to prepare in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.  I found that this in-depth and analytical approach filled in the gaps often left by purely conversation-based coaching.  Janine demonstrated an encyclopaedic knowledge of my pre-work (impressive given her expansive client portfolio) that was (and still is) used as a springboard for insightful, challenging and valuable interactions. Janine’s style ensures that she brings a sense of youthfulness and energy to her engagements.  An energy she imparts and transfers selflessly leaving this client with a lasting sense of motivation and power to overcome challenges and deliver on difficult and complex business objectives. The coach/client relationship is one that if successful lays bare weaknesses and vulnerability and as a consequence is based on trust. From the start I could see Janine is a warm genuine person, who oozes integrity, honesty and loyalty. Through expert listening skills she quickly understands, peels back the layers, cajoles and challenges.  She is committed to clients during the engagement and afterwards for however long it takes.  Over 12 months since our first meeting and long after the engagement has officially expired Janine contacts and meets me regularly to check up on me. The ‘Janine experience’ has left this customer with an ongoing valuable relationship where I am continually amazed by her level of commitment in me.  I unreservedly recommend Janine Bunnetta with the confidence that I know she will bring a powerful, positive and lasting impression to any organisation and its leaders"

  <p>"Janine has an innate ability to enable you to evaluate your career strategy in a clear and concise way. Her holistic coaching approach allows you to better realise your strengths and achievements, focus your career plan and develop your professional vision. On a business level, Janine is highly astute and outcome focused, she works in such as way as to generate tangible results through self-exploration. Janine is a real people person and injects charisma into her methods. She demonstrates great pride in her work and goes the extra mile to ensure her clients get real benefit out of the experience"
  <p>Ciaran Jay – Director of IT and Operations Xtralis 
  <p>"Janine made me realize that there are other approaches and by focusing on all the talents that I could bring to the table for O2’s benefit that naturally O2 would do whatever they could to help me get the right work/life balance. I am now in the happy position where I have moved to a 3 day week with a company not known for offering such flexibility and focusing on an area of work which best suits my skills. Truly that is all down to Janine’s coaching – she really helped me focus on the important stuff and gave me the confidence to ask for something which I would never have gone after prior to getting onto the programme with her. Janine was fantastic. She has the happy knack of coaching you to come up with a solution which you almost believe you came up with yourself!!  She has a great understanding of the Corporate world and blended with her natural intuition about people manages to identify how one can go after what they want and need from their career"
  <p>Amy Ball – Senior Manager Advisory Consulting PWC Ireland
  <p>"I worked with Janine during a period of significant change within the business.  We worked on identifying and resolving key business challenges, departmental team performance and reaching the next level in my own personal performance and career development.  I found Janine's insights and ability to challenge to be extremely beneficial in providing the focus to take on and succeed in new leadership role"
  <p>Andrew Peirce – Former Head of Finance, Premier Foods Ireland Limited
  <p>"Janine somehow manages to turn a potentially daunting experience into an enjoyable self-affirming exercise, as you map out your strengths and career opportunities you discover you've got a first class ally with you each step of the way. Investing in improving your chances of success is always money well spent, never more so in this case."

  <h1>TEAM INTERVENTIONS</h1>
  <p>"Our office used High Noon during 2015 to facilitate inter-active training modules for our middle-management team. The programme primarily focused on how to achieve more with less and how to motivate teams to give their best in a very difficult operating environment. We brought High Noon on board because we needed perspectives that included the best of both public sector and private sector practices ‘tailored’ in a way that suited the specifics of our operations. We also needed a delivery method that engaged very experienced personnel in a way that got them thinking about and challenging conventional methodologies rather than ‘going through the motions’. I had previously seen Janine and her team deliver some outstanding work in this area for other entities and I was very confident that they could do likewise for us. The modules were an outstanding success and delivered beyond expectations. An additional bonus for our office is that the modules developed for us by High Noon have been incorporated into our internal training programme and are now being delivered by in-house trainers"
